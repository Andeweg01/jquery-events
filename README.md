jquery module on events

### First challenge
Using the card panel example we worked on in the last lesson:

Inside your script.js file, add a click event which will trigger when a 'p' tag is clicked and will change the color of all 'p' tags to red.
When a 'h2' is hovered over, the background of all h2's are changed to the colour lightblue.
When a 'h2' is hovered over its font size increases, but only for that particular h2
When a button is hovered, the background color of the page turns black.
When a button is no longer hovered, the background color of the page turns grey.

### Challenge on effects

Edit your html file to change all the 'a' tags to 'button' elements. Donâ€™t forget the closing tag and to remove the href attribute. Make the first button hide when clicked.

On the same button, try the slow, medium, fast, and a number in milliseconds (you will need to refresh to get the button back).
